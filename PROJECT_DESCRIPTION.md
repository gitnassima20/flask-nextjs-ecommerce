# E-Commerce Website Project

## Objective
Develop a functional single-page e-commerce website with product management and cart functionality, integrated with a backend for data storage.

## Assignment: Build a Single-Page E-Commerce Website

### Requirements
Develop a visually appealing single-page e-commerce website where users can:
- **Add Products** – Users should be able to add new products with a name, price, and image.
- **Delete Products** – Users should be able to remove existing products from the listing.
- **Add to Cart** – Users should be able to add products to a shopping cart.
- **Cart Management** – The cart should display selected products and allow users to remove items.
- **Backend Integration** – Store and manage all product and cart data in a database.

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend:
- Use any framework like React/Vue, or NextJs.
- Display a list of available products dynamically.
- Implement basic validation (e.g., prevent adding empty products).
- Use AJAX/Fetch API to interact with the backend without reloading the page.

#### Backend:
- Use Python (Flask) to create RESTful APIs.
- Implement API endpoints for:
  - Adding a product
  - Deleting a product
  - Retrieving the product list
  - Adding/removing products from the cart
- Use a database for data storage.
- Ensure proper API error handling and validation.

### Bonus (Optional Enhancements):
- Add local storage or user authentication to track cart data across sessions.
- Implement a basic admin panel to manage products.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit code via the GitHub repository.
- Provide a README.md with setup instructions.
- Deploy the project.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- ✔ Code structure and readability
- ✔ API design and database integration
- ✔ Frontend-Backend communication
- ✔ UI/UX implementation
- ✔ Bonus features (if any)
